#Here is a code for display of the auto-correlation of a wave packet in the time-domain. 
#Other functions, such as sine, gaussian, and square waves are also defined in the script as examples.
#You can select any waveform as input,and display the animation for auto-corr or cross-corr.

#The cross-corr is calculated in the time-domain (via numpy.dot or panda.corr)
